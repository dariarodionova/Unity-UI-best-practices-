# Unity UI best practices
## General
### Naming
Just like objects in the scene, UI elements should be named sensibly with an indicator of the element type.
Every separate UI entity (for ex. Health Bar, Ammo counter, Stamina Bar) should be organized using an empty gameObject, with a consistent name, for instance “Content”.
